# Marketing/Production Frontend Developer

## Task 1

Setup:

```cd task1```  

```npm install``` 

If you want to make changes ```npm run watch```

I used ```simplelineicons``` for the icon pack which look slightly different from the ones used in the design.

## Task 2

Setup:

```cd task2```  

```node script.js```

Output will be a list of the following categories: ```[ 'Clothing', 'Coats', 'Trench & Raincoats' ]```


## Task 3

I would use ```google-translate``` npm package to run through any translatable text and translate it into the users requested language. This could be illustrated with a country flag at the top of the landing page to let the user choose the language they wish to browse the site in, or it could be tied to the region/currency dropdown that already exists.

I have added a very small section of example code to do this at ```line 28``` in ```farfetch/task1/script.js```

This would be better than manually adding in translations as it would be both faster and cheaper to automate this process.
